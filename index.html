                <p><b>SpongeBob SquarePants</b>is a yellow sea sponge and the main character of the show. His house is made from a pineapple.

                <p><b>Patrick Star</b>is a pink starfish who is SpongeBob's best friend. He lives under a rock and is not very smart. He likes to have fun and be silly, but sometimes gets himself and SpongeBob in trouble. He usually does not have a job. He is voiced by Bill Fagerbakke.</i></p>
                <p><b>Squidward Tentacles</b>is an octopus and SpongeBob's next-door neighbor. He plays the clarinet and is not good at it, even though he thinks so. He works at the Krusty Krab as the cashier. He says he hates SpongeBob, but SpongeBob thinks they are friends. Squidward is not friendly and thinks that he is better than almost everyone. He is voiced by Rodger Bumpass.</p>
                <p><b>Mr. Krabs</b>is a crab who is the owner of the Krusty Krab restaurant, and SpongeBob and Squidward's boss. He is a single father with one daughter, a whale named Pearl.

                <p><b>Sandy Cheeks</b>is a squirrel from the state of Texas. She lives in a glass house called a Treedome that lets her breathe under water. While she is out of the dome, she wears a space suit and a fishbowl-like glass helmet around her head filled with fresh air. She is very athletic and works as a scientist. She is voiced by Carolyn Lawrence.</p>
                <p><b>Mrs. Puff</b>is a pufferfish who is SpongeBob's teacher at the underwater driving school, Mrs. Puff's Boating School. She is old, patient, and easily scared. She wears a blue sailor hat and a yellow wig. SpongeBob really wants to pass Mrs. Puff's class, but he always fails his driving test. She is voiced by Mary Jo Catlett.</p>
                <p><b>Gary the Snail</b>is SpongeBob's pet snail who lives with him in their pineapple house. He meows and acts like a cat. He cannot talk, but SpongeBob can understand him. Gary is usually shown to be very smart. He is voiced by Tom Kenny.</p>

                    <p>Since its founding in 1979, Nickelodeon has developed many good-for-you programs—Blues Clues, Dora the Explorer—aimed at spurring kids’ education and development. SpongeBob is not one of those shows. But it’s the most funny, surreal, inventive example of the explosion in creative kids’ (and adult) entertainment that Nick, Cartoon Network and their ilk made possible. Animator and marine-biology teacher Stephen Hillenburg translated the objects of his study in to the Dadaist world of Bikini Bottom, where the title character flips Krabbie Patties, creates disasters and gets by on good-natured innocence. SpongeBob may not have a spine, or much of a brain, but he’s all heart. </p>
                    <p>SpongeBob SquarePants is one of those rare pieces of pop culture gold that has managed to travel far beyond its initial standing as a children’s cartoon, and is beloved (ironically or not) by kids and adults alike. Even if it’s been a while since you’ve seen the show, chances are you can still sing its theme song by heart, recalling all the lyrics about the absorbent and yellow fry cook who lives in a pineapple under the sea.</p>
                    <p>In fact, SpongeBob‘s firm place in pop culture has led to a wide range of bizarre, clever, and downright creepy fan interpretations and reimagining of the show. In that vein, an animator and YouTuber called Narmak decided to reimagine the show’s theme as if it were an anime. Not only did the opening song get an anime makeover, but the tone of the show and the characters themselves did, too. We saw it first over at i09, and thought the results were nothing short of hilarious. Take a look for yourself:</p>
                    <p>Narmak gives Bikini Bottom quite the dramatic makeover as an anime, turning SpongeBob and Patrick into grizzled warriors for good (and protectors of the Krabby Pattie Secret Formula, I imagine). Meanwhile, Squidward morphs from an unhappy employee of the Krusty Krab to a vengeful assassin (who looks similar to the Handsome Squidward in the episode where Squiddy gets facial reconstructive surgery) who literally slices Patrick into pieces. #RIPPatrick</p>
