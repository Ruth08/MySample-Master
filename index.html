                <h2>Main Characters</h2>
                <p>SpongeBob SquarePants is a yellow sea sponge and the main character of the show. His house is made from a pineapple. He works as a fry cook at a fast food restaurant called the Krusty Krab. He is talented at making burgers called Krabby Patties. He is voiced by Tom Kenny.</p>
                <p>Patrick Star is a pink starfish who is SpongeBob's best friend. He lives under a rock and is not very smart. He likes to have fun and be silly, but sometimes gets himself and SpongeBob in trouble. He usually does not have a job. He is voiced by Bill Fagerbakke.</p>
                <p>Squidward Tentacles is an octopus and SpongeBob's next-door neighbor. He plays the clarinet and is not good at it, even though he thinks so. He works at the Krusty Krab as the cashier. He says he hates SpongeBob, but SpongeBob thinks they are friends. Squidward is not friendly and thinks that he is better than almost everyone. He is voiced by Rodger Bumpass.</p>
                <p>Mr. Krabs is a crab who is the owner of the Krusty Krab restaurant, and SpongeBob and Squidward's boss. He is a single father with one daughter, a whale named Pearl. He and Pearl live in a big anchor. He is very greedy and loves money. He never wants to spend a lot of his money, and sometimes cheats to make more of it. He is voiced by Clancy Brown.</p>
                <p>Sheldon J. Plankton is an evil green plankton. He is an evil genius and Mr. Krabs' rival. His goal is to steal the recipe for Krabby Patties. He runs a restaurant called the Chum Bucket with the help of his talking computer named Karen. The Chum Bucket is very unpopular and they never get customers. He is voiced by Mr. Lawrence.</p>
                <p>Sandy Cheeks is a squirrel from the state of Texas. She lives in a glass house called a Treedome that lets her breathe under water. While she is out of the dome, she wears a space suit and a fishbowl-like glass helmet around her head filled with fresh air. She is very athletic and works as a scientist. She is voiced by Carolyn Lawrence.</p>
                <p>Mrs. Puff is a pufferfish who is SpongeBob's teacher at the underwater driving school, Mrs. Puff's Boating School. She is old, patient, and easily scared. She wears a blue sailor hat and a yellow wig. SpongeBob really wants to pass Mrs. Puff's class, but he always fails his driving test. She is voiced by Mary Jo Catlett.</p>
                <p>Gary the Snail is SpongeBob's pet snail who lives with him in their pineapple house. He meows and acts like a cat. He cannot talk, but SpongeBob can understand him. Gary is usually shown to be very smart. He is voiced by Tom Kenny.</p>
